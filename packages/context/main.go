package main

// Package context defines the Context type, which carries deadlines, cancellation signals,
// and other request-scoped values across API boundaries and between processes

// Do not store Contexts inside a struct type; instead, pass a Context explicitly to each
// function that needs it. The Context should be the first parameter, typically named ctx

func main() {
