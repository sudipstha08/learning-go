# Cron jobs are time-based jobs which are programmed to run on a 
# specific time interval. App Engine cron service automatically 
# triggers the cron jobs that operate at a regular interval or defined 
# time. App Engine cron service will invoke a URL by using a HTTP get request.

#  The URL in your app to which you want the Cron service to send job requests
